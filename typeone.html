        <h2>What is Type One?</h2>
        <h4>What causes it? What is insulin?</h4>
        <p>Type One Diabetes is a chronic, autoimmune disease that is not preventable or curable. The body's own immune
            system - which normally fights harmful bacteria and viruses - mistakes the insulin producing
            cells in the pancreas as harmful and destroys them, leaving the body unable to produce, and then use,
            insulin. The exact <strong>why</strong> this happens, is unknown. There is some speculation that genetics or
            an exposure to viruses and other environmental factors are at play.
        </p>
        <p>So what <em>is</em> insulin? Insulin acts as the key that allows glucose to enter the body's cells and
            provide it with energy. Insulin is
            the bridge between the food you eat and the energy you recieve. Without it, your body is no longer getting
            energy. When a body is no longer recieving energy from their food they enter into ketoacidosis.
        </p>
        <div class="about-box">
            <p>Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) is a serious complication of diabetes that can be
                life-threatening. DKA develops when your body doesn't have enough insulin to allow blood sugar into your
                cells for use as
                energy. Instead, your liver breaks down fat for fuel, a process that produces acids called ketones. When
                too many ketones are produced too fast, they can build up to dangerous levels in your body.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="treatment">
            <h2>Type One Treatment</h2>
            <h4>Treatment includes:</h4>
            <ul class="">
                <li>Taking insulin</li>
                <li>Carbohydrate, fat, and protein counting</li>
                <li>Frequent blood sugar monitoring</li>
                <li>Eating healthy</li>
                <li>Exercising regularly and maintaining a healthy weight</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The goal is to keep your blood sugar as close to normal as possible to prevent complications in the
                future.
                A target blood sugar range is between 80 and 130 mg/dl before meals, and no higher than 180 mg/dl two
                hours
                after eating. Though, because of the difficult nature of T1D, those numbers can fall below or raise
                above
                the 'target range' throughout the day.
            </p>
            <h4>Life after diagnosis</h4>
            <p>
                Anyone with T1D needs lifelong insulin therapy. There are different types of insulin - Short acting
                (regular), rapid acting, intermediate actiong, and long acting. Use of these insulin types vary from
                T1D's.
                Insulin can be administered in two mains ways:
                <img src="https://diabeteson.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/insulin-pump-diabetes-technology-devices-treatment-management-cgm-1.png"
                    alt="insulin pump" class="right-picture" width="150">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Injection.</strong> Using a fine needle and syringe or an insulin pen you inject insulin
                    under
                    your skin.
                    Injections are given before every meal and snack and when the blood sugar levels are too high.</li>
                <li><strong>Insulin pump.</strong> You wear this device, which is about the size of a cellphone, on the
                    outside of your body. A tube connects a reservoir of insulin to a catheter that's inserted under the
                    skin of your abdomen. When you eat, you program the pump with the amount of carbohydrates you're
                    eating
                    and your current blood sugar, and it will give you what's called a bolus dose of insulin to cover
                    your
                    meal and to correct your blood sugar if it's elevated. Some research has found that in some people
                    an
                    insulin pump can be more effective at controlling blood sugar levels than injections. An insulin
                    pump
                    combined with a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device may provide even tighter blood sugar
                    control.

            </ul>
            </p>
            <h4>Blood Sugar Monitoring</h4>
            <p>Blood sugar testing is suggested before meals and snack, before bed, after wake up in the morning, before
                exercising and driving, and if you suspect your blood sugar is out of range. Even if you use insulin on
                a
                rigid schedule, eat healthy, and exercise, blood sugar levels are still subject to unexpected changes.
                Blood
                sugar levels can change in response to food, activity, illness, medications, stress, hormonal changes,
                and
                alcohol.</p>
            <p>A continuous glocose monitor (CGM) is a monitor attached to the body that uses a fine needle just under
                the
                skin and checks the blood sugar about every five minutes. This replaces, for the most part, hourly
                finger
                pokes.</p>

            <h2>My Type One Story</h2>
            <h4>On June 14, 2017...</h4>
            <p>
                When I was 17 years old, I was diagnosed with Type One Diabetes through a life-threatening case of
                Diabetic
                Ketoacidosis. After a week of not feeling well - nausea, no appetite, headaches, frequent urination,
                dehydration, and extreme weight loss - I was brought to urgent care. It was clear to the doctor
                something
                was wrong, and he conveyed his concern to my mom. They had me tested for mono by a blood draw, which
                left me
                bruised from inner elbow to wrist because of severe dehydration. They told my mom that if they did not
                hear
                back from them then it wasn't mono and to schedule an appointment with my primary care doctor for more
                testing.
            </p>
            <p>To be quite plain, I do not remember much of what came next. Most of this part of the story comes from
                others
                relaying what happened. A different doctor from urgent care called my parents that night around 8:30 pm.
                He
                told them he was shocked no one had called me sooner, because I needed immediate medical attention. He
                instructed them to bring me to Helen Devos Children's Hospital, and he had already let them know I was
                on my
                way. When we arrived I was rushed back and put on multiple IVs. My weight had dropped around 28lbs
                within
                the last few months, my potassium levels were dangerously low, and my blood sugar was a shocking 794
                mg/dl.
                Keep in mind, the average nondiabetic's sugar ranges from 70-120 mg/dl. The doctor who saw me at the
                hospital diagnosed me with Type One Diabetes and said if I hadn't come in that night, there was a good
                chance I wouldn't have woken up the next morning.
            </p>
            <p>
                I spent three days in the hospital hooked to IVs to return my potassium and blood sugar to closer to
                normal
                levels. I received education on how to count carbs, use carb to insulin ratios to figure out bolus
                amounts,
                how to correct high blood sugar, how to correct low blood sugar, how to use a blood sugar monitor, how
                to
                give injections, and some general ins and outs. Then, after three days with this life-altering disease,
                I
                was released from the hospital and sent home.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since then I have worked hard to learn what my blood sugar responds well to, eat balanced meals, and
                exercise. I now wear an insulin pump and CGM. I still enjoy those sweet carbs but am mindful of some of
                the
                consequences. My endocrinologist is always reminding me I can eat what I want, I just have to remember
                it
                affects me more than it used to. Diabetes doesn't have to hold me back. Yes, sometimes it sucks.
                Sometimes
                my emotions dictate my blood sugar and give me uncontrollable numbers. Many times it feels overwhelming
                and
                like it keeps me from living life to the fullest. The reality is, T1D is just another facet of my life.
                It
                certainly doesn't define me, it just comes with me wherever I go.
